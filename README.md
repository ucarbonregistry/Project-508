# Project-508
20 MW Enercon Wind farms (SAI) Pvt. Limited in Maharashtra

The wind farm of Enercon wind farms (SAI) Pvt. Limited has an installed capacity of 20 MW
and the entire power generated is being exported to the Maharashtra state grid which is a part
of the western regional electricity grid. The project activity consists of the installation of 25
wind energy generators (WEGs) each of 800 kW rating, thereby aggregating to 20 MW, in the
Panchpatta, village in Akole Taluk of Ahmednager District in the state of Maharashtra state in
India. All the WEGs in the project have been supplied by Enercon (India) Ltd, who is also
responsible for the operation, maintenance and management of the project.

The project is expected to generate 36 792 MWh of energy per annum at a plant load factor of
21% /6/ and has also been cross checked against independent third party generation
estimation report from Fair Aero Consultant & Technologist dated 10 November 2006. DNV
can confirm that the PLF assumed by project proponent is reasonable /38/.

The starting date of the project activity has been identified as 17 August 2006, which is the
date of purchase order placed for the wind turbines of the project activity /7/. The lifetime of
the project is 20 years which is reasonable for a WEG /46/. The project has selected a fixed
crediting period of 10 years with the start date of the crediting period to be 1 November 2010
(or on the date of registration of the CDM project activity, whichever is later). The project is
expected to result in 33 348 tCO2e emission reductions per annum over the crediting period.

The first machine under the project activity was commissioned on 28 February 2007 and last
machine was commissioned on 17 March 2009.
